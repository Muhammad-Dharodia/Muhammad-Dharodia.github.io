# Becoming a Hafiz Al-Qur'an requires dedication, consistency, and sincerity. The journey begins with setting a strong intention (niyyah) to memorize the Holy Qur'an for the sake of Allah. Finding a qualified teacher or enrolling in a Hifz program at a madrasa is essential to ensure proper recitation (Tajweed) and memorization techniques. Establishing a daily schedule with a fixed amount of verses to memorize and regularly revising previous lessons is crucial for retention. Seeking Allahâ€™s help through dua (supplication), maintaining patience, and staying away from distractions will strengthen focus. Surrounding oneself with a supportive environment, including family and peers who encourage and remind, also plays a vital role. With sincere effort, perseverance, and reliance on Allah, one can complete the memorization of the Qur'an and become a Hafiz. Here is a link to a video # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrnK5RDawWM. I know one person who has memorized the Qur'an in 10 years and is in grade 6 So the secret is. He comes back from School and finishes all of his homework After that, he reads the Qur'an from Magrib to Isha, which will take one hour at least 1 hour. Pls be like him
