# Becoming a Hafiz Al-Qur'an requires dedication, consistency, and sincerity. The journey begins with setting a strong intention (niyyah) to memorize the Holy Qur'an for the sake of Allah. Finding a qualified teacher or enrolling in a Hifz program at a madrasa is essential to ensure proper recitation (Tajweed) and memorization techniques. Establishing a daily schedule with a fixed amount of verses to memorize and regularly revising previous lessons is crucial for retention. Seeking Allahâ€™s help through dua (supplication), maintaining patience, and staying away from distractions will strengthen focus. Surrounding oneself with a supportive environment, including family and peers who encourage and remind, also plays a vital role. With sincere effort, perseverance, and reliance on Allah, one can complete the memorization of the Qur'an and become a Hafiz. Here is a link to a video # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrnK5RDawWM
